/**
 * What a POS export's Status column means.
 *
 * The importer used to compare against the single literal 'approved', so a till
 * that writes "Completed", "Paid" or "Successful" had every row counted as
 * declined and silently skipped — the upload finished reporting "0 imported,
 * N skipped, 0 errors", which reads as a broken importer rather than a
 * vocabulary mismatch. Yoco writes "Approved"; nothing guarantees the next
 * vendor does.
 *
 * An unrecognised value is still declined — importing a row whose status we do
 * not understand would be a guess about money — but it is flagged so the caller
 * can tell the operator which word it did not know, instead of saying nothing.
