/**
 * Trims a chat thread to the history window we send to the provider.
 *
 * The Messages API requires `messages[0]` to use the `user` role. A chat
 * alternates user/assistant and always ends on the new question, so the Nth
 * question carries 2N-1 messages; from the sixth question on, a blind
 * `slice(-10)` dropped index 0 and opened the window on an assistant turn. The
 * provider answered that with a 400, withAnthropicErrors turned it into a
 * generic 503, and the owner was told the AI was down — permanently, for that
 * thread, because every retry sent the same array. Re-anchor the window to the
 * oldest user turn it contains so a whole exchange is dropped rather than half
 * of one.
 *
 * `truncatedMessages` counts questions we shortened, so the caller can say so
 * instead of silently answering the first 4000 characters of a longer paste.
